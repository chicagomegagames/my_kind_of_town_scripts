# My Kind of Town Follower Generator

Generate random generic followers for [My Kind of Town](https://chicagomegagames.com/games/my_kind_of_town/).

## Background

My Kind of Town is a post-zombie outbreak megagame, played by up to 40 players.
The game mechanics themselves are fairly simple, and once play starts there's nothing tedious enough to need automation.
Unfortunately, that's not true of preparing the game.

Because of the nature of My Kind of Town, a large number of followers need to be generated before the game.
These followers all have a gender, height, weight, and eye color, mostly for flavor, but it adds something to the followers.
Doing this by hand is fairly tedious, just because ideally it's based on some form of real-world statistics.
